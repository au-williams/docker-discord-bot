# docker-discord-bot

My Discord bot made with [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) for the scalable automation of tasks. [Docker image](https://github.com/au-williams/docker-discord-bot/pkgs/container/discord-bot) is packaged using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/au-williams/docker-discord-bot/actions) CI/CD. üêãüì¶

This project can be started from CLI with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) ...

```bash
$ node index.js
```

Or be started with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) using the [Docker image](https://github.com/au-williams/docker-discord-bot/pkgs/container/discord-bot) ...

```
ghcr.io/au-williams/discord-bot:master
```

‚≠ê **Docker is recommended so the bot can automatically start and recover from network issues.** ‚≠ê

## Anatomy of the bot

The bot is a framework meant to automate many code-heavy tasks working with the Discord API. You simply need to add a new JavaScript file to the `plugins` folder to add functionality. You must export one or more of these objects in that script ...

<details>
  <summary>üì§ export const CronJobs</summary>

---

```js
import CronJobScheduler from "../entities/CronJobScheduler.js";

export const CronJobs = new Set([
  new CronJobScheduler().setFunction(myFunction).setPattern("* * * * *")
]);
```

_[Cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression) is a job scheduler that runs functions on an [expression](https://devhints.io/cron), like every 20 minutes or every Saturday at 9 AM. The bot framework automatically schedules the Cron jobs you create here. You can customize the Cron job with the following setters ..._

| Setters      | Required | Purpose                                                             |
| ------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| setEnabled   | `false`  | Sets the enabled state of the Cron job (typically for debugging).   |
| setFunction  | `true`   | Sets the function to execute when the Cron job is running.          |
| setPattern   | `true`   | Sets the Cron expression used when scheduling the Cron job.         |
| setRunOrder  | `false`  | Sets the order this Cron job runs with others to avoid race issues. |
| setTriggered | `false`  | Sets if the Cron job should run on startup and before the pattern.  |

---

</details>

<details>
  <summary>üì§ export const Interactions</summary>

---

```js
export const Interactions = Object.freeze({
  ButtonComponentWave: "PLUGIN_BUTTON_COMPONENT_WAVE"
});
```

_Every action in Discord can be thought of as an interaction. Clicking buttons, submitting forms, sending messages, etc. When we create buttons to click or forms to submit we must assign them a unique ID that Discord will emit back to us when it has been interacted with. These unique IDs are set on components and used as keys in the `Listeners` object._

---

</details>

<details>
  <summary>üì§ export const Listeners</summary>

---

```js
import Listener from "../entities/Listener.js";

export const Listeners = Object.freeze({
  [Interactions.ButtonComponentWave]: new Listener()
    .setDescription("Sends the wave emoji when the button is clicked.")
    .setFunction(onButtonComponentWave)
});
```

_Listeners handle actions. The property key is a Discord event or interaction from the `Interactions` object. The value is a `Listener` object that will be executed when the key is emitted by Discord. Listeners that only set a function can use that function as the value and the framework will automatically wrap it in a Listener. You can use an array to create multiple Listener values for a single key. You can customize the Listener with the following setters ..._

| Setters                | Required | Purpose                                                             |
| ---------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| setBusyFunction        | `false`  | Sets the function to execute when the listener is flagged as busy.  |
| setDeploymentType      | `false`  | Sets the type of POST request to use when deploying to Discord.     |
| setDescription         | `false`  | Sets the text displayed when describing functionality to the user.  |
| setEnabled             | `false`  | Sets the enabled state of the listener (typically for debugging).   |
| setFunction            | `true`   | Sets the function to execute when the listener is authorized.       |
| setLockedUserFunction  | `false`  | Sets the function to execute when the listener is not authorized.   |
| setRequiredChannels    | `false`  | Sets the channel ID(s) required for the listener to be executed.    |
| setRequiredChannelType | `false`  | Sets the channel type required for the listener to be executed.     |
| setRequiredRoles       | `false`  | Sets the role ID(s) a user must possess one of to be authorized.    |
| setRunOrder            | `false`  | Sets the order this listener runs with others to avoid race issues. |

JavaScript files in the `services` folder operate the same as plugins but are dependencies of the bot framework. Thus when handling errors plugins will catch and release while services will throw to avoid an invalid system state. You can use these services in your plugin by referencing them ...

## Deploying the bot

<!-- ## Creating plugins

The `index.js` file handles [discord.js events](https://old.discordjs.dev/#/docs/discord.js/14.9.0/typedef/Events) and invokes the corresponding function names in `./plugins/` JavaScript files. Simply creating a new JavaScript file with an appropriately named function is enough for it to execute - but you **_should_** add the config and readme files for optimal code quality.

```
./plugins/
‚Ü≥ example_plugin_config.json
‚Ü≥ example_plugin_readme.md
‚Ü≥ example_plugin_script.js
```

### Querying message history

The `index.js` file maintains the message history of guild channels to reduce the overall number of API requests sent to Discord. A channels message history is lazy-loaded on the first invocation and automatically kept up-to-date after.

```js
import { getChannelMessages } from "../index.js";

const predicate = ({ author, content }) => author === "foo" || content === "bar";
const messages = getChannelMessages("YOUR_DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID").filter(predicate);
```

_**Note:** You can load channels on startup with the `"discord_prefetch_channel_ids"` config value! This is useful when there's noticeable delay lazy-loading a channel with a large number of messages._

### Registering slash commands

You can register slash commands for a plugin by exporting the `PLUGIN_COMMANDS` array.

```js
// define "/hello-world" slash command
export const PLUGIN_COMMANDS = [
  {
    name: "hello-world",
    description: `Prints "Hello World" to the console`,
    onInteractionCreate: () => console.log("Hello World!")
  }
];
```

**You must start the bot with the `deploy` arg for any slash command changes to take effect:**

```bash
$ node index.js deploy
```

This sends a PUT request to Discord containing the updated slash commands during startup.
